# basketball_simulation
A basketball management simulation. A long-term project that is very much in its early, rough stages. Using Python and integrating SQLite.

# CSC512
As part of CSC512 at Cornell College 2021, I will be attempting to implement the single-game simulation.

I am considering two approaches:
* Write a system that simulates the game one play at a time. I will research data and tendencies from real basketball games, weighted random determination, and my own knowledge of basketball to build the system.
* Use machine learning to simulate the game one play at a time. I will use existing play-by-play data to build a model that predicts the next play in a game based on what happened previously. This is the more adventurous and perhaps less realistic approach.

I intend to begin with a cursory attempt at the machine learning approach. I believe I will discover quickly, through this experience, whether or not it is a practical approach.

I have found some candidate play-by-play datasets to use for training. The most comprehensive dataset contains 19 seasons of NBA play-by-play data but costs $399. There are free datasets that have less seasons' worth of data.

By the third week of Block 2, if the machine learning approach is not feasible, I will commit to the first approach. I am willing to put in the 24+ hours required into the approach even if I have already spent significant time on machine learning.
